# Taiko sim RS 

why: 
1. there isnt a dedicated Taiko sim on linux, currently the only option is Osu Lazer.
2. bevy engine is very modular hopefully this will allow user to edit the game easier.
3. rust and bevy engine are fun.
 

## This is a work in progress there is no functonality and the only map that will load is the debuging/testing map

### Install instruction 
1. Install [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) 
2. Run cargo build --release 
3. Move the executable from target/release to TaikoRS 
4. you can now copy TaikoRS anywhere you want too

## Random stuff I don't know where to put

I am new to programming so the code is probably weird and innfiecient if you see something you want to change for the better please do! also it would be nice if you could explain how and why it is better :)

also I don't have github experience so please be patient if something doesnt work or is weird

[random ideas on how it could work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12wOqsNfpZ7JMxY0Q6h1AUVH8UFUX0rcy8iQJl-oIL-U/edit?usp=sharing)
